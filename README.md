# Sample Project for Google Cloud Spanner with Entity Framwork Core

This project contains a small sample application that uses Entity Framework Core to insert and query data in a Cloud Spanner database.
The sample application is self-contained and does not require any manual setup or any active Google Cloud subscription. It will automatically
start an in-memory emulator of Cloud Spanner and execute the sample application against the emulator.
